# heuristicSearch
The project aims to experience how to derive heuristics, using the Berkely Pac Man framework, as a requirement to complete the AI Planning for Autonomy (COMP90054) 
at The University of Melbourne.

In this project, the Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently.
General search algorithms have been built and applied to Pacman scenarios.

The files search.py and searchAgents.py are the only files that have edited to add the required search algorithms.
